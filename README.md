# PCB- The Blinking-Bao

# Project Background
> The Bao (also known as Baozi) is a Chinese delicacy which is enjoyed by people all around the world. It consists of a slice of stewed meat and condiments sandwiched between flat steamed bread known as lotus leaf bread. The Bao is typically 6â€“8 centimetres in size, semi-circular and flat in form, with a horizontal fold that, when opened, gives the appearance that it has been sliced. Although the origin of this delicacy lies in Northern China, there are numerous variations of the Bao in China and South East Asian countries like Indonesia, Cambodia and also Phillipines.

# Project Description
> I am a food vlog enthusiast and I love to learn about various cuisines around the globe. This project basically takes inspiration from the Bao. I have designed the PCB in a shape similar to the Bao with the meat filling and veggies. The USELESS DESIGN COMPETITION conducted by ALLPCB was the perfect chance to showcase this design. 

> The circuit basically consists of LEDs which represent the meat, greens and veggies. The circuit runs on a 9V power supply and has a Timer IC 555 which controls the blinking of LEDs. I have designed the circuit such  that the value of the time constant equals 1 second. Thus, the LEDs remain in ON state for a time period of 1 second and then in the OFF state for another 1 second. The values of the capacitor and resistor can be varied so as to achieve various time constants and hence, change the frequency at which the LED blinks. 


> The entire design of the PCB was done on EasyEDA Online PCB Design Tool. After the design was complete, I ordered the PCB from ALLPCB. ALLPCB is a very renowned PCB Manufacturer and provides excellent quality PCBs at a very low cost.
