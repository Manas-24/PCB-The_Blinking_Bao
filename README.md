# Project Background
> The Bao (also known as Baozi) is a Chinese delicacy which is enjoyed by people all around the world. It consists of a slice of stewed meat and condiments sandwiched between flat steamed bread known as lotus leaf bread. The Bao is typically 6â€“8 centimetres in size, semi-circular and flat in form, with a horizontal fold that, when opened, gives the appearance that it has been sliced. Although the origin of this delicacy lies in Northern China, there are numerous variations of the Bao in China and South East Asian countries like Indonesia, Cambodia and also Phillipines.
